## Data
Please download the AVSBench dataset including S4 and MS3 subsets following [https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/AVSBench](https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/AVSBench).


### Extracted Flows for S4 and MS3 Data
We have extracted flows based on AVSBench S4 and MS3 datasets. Please download the data.



### Extracted Flows for MS3 Extended Data
We additionally sampled semantic-similar unannotated samples to enhance MS3 data in training.
Please download the data.



## Backbones 
Following previous works such as TPAVI and AVSegFormer, we utilize image-pretrained ResNet and PVT-v2 as image backbones, and AudioSet pretrained VGGish as audio backbone.
Please download the pretrained backbones.
